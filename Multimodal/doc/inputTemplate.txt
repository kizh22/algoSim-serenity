these will probably change over the period but for now keep everything on the same line to make things easier

<graph [name]> 				-- Name for the graph, this will be shown on the load menu
	algo([algorithm])		-- can be Prims, Kruskals or Dijkstras atm
	graph([graph type]) 	-- this is intimated to be undirected unless other wise stated
	input([input type])		-- this controls the input type, if not included it will use the default numpad
	node([node type])		-- this controls how the nodes should be drawn, if this is set to auto then the nodes don't need a size attribute
	teachingMode()			-- this controls how the user can interact with the program, this mode extends the functionality if the simulator
	advancedMode()			-- same as above, but this mode extends the functionality of the GUI
	

	<node> 					-- tells the interpreter that the next few lines refer to a node
		Location(x, y)	   	-- tells the interpreter where to draw the node
		size(#)				-- tells the interpreter the size of the node in pixels
		name([name])    	-- this is not required, but if present then it should over-ride the displayed name for the node
		rootNode()			-- if either of these is included then these will be set to be the root / end for this graph
		endNode()			-- if both are included then the last will be used
	...

	<edge> 					-- the next few lines are on a new edge
		node0(#)			-- the start node (id of the node)
		node1(#)			-- the end node (id of the node) -- the ID will be written into the saved file to make it easier when being looked at, but wont actually be used in the code
		weight(##.##)		-- the weight of the edge, in double format... ie 13.9
	...

 -- when loading a graph it will use the preset options, to change it just chose the options beforehand as per normal, or while drawing the graph
